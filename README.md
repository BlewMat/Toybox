## Lints and Formatting in Rust

The best rust tools require the nightly compiler (because they don't want to stabilize the compiler internals yet). Follow the readme instructions to get [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) and [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy).

Then you can check automatically format your files with ``cargo +nightly fmt`` and peruse the best lints with ``cargo +nightly clippy``.
